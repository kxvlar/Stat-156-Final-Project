The goal of this assignment is to apply learned methods from this course to analyze real- world datasets and
critically appraise causal claims made in academic publications. This project is a group assignment with
each group consisting of no more than two students.
It is strongly recommended that students replicate and re-analyze the results of an academic
paper whose original datasets or similar datasets are publicly available. Datasets provided by
authors on the publication website are cleaned already and should match the authors published results
exactly, so please do not use the cleaned datasets on the publication website unless the paper
is an experimental study. As a part of the replication exercise, you and your group should download
the original dataset and clean it to approximately match the sample selection used in the published paper.
For other forms of final project assignments, such as a literature review with simulation studies to compare
multiple methods, please attend the GSI’s office hour

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

This paper is a replication and critical re-analysis of the seminal work, "Consumption Responses to In-Kind Transfers: Evidence from the Introduction of the Food Stamp Program" by Hilary W. Hoynes and Diane Schanzenbach.

This paper presents a replication-style reassessment of the landmark study “Consumption Responses to In-Kind Transfers: Evidence from the Introduction of the Food Stamp Program” by Hilary Hoynes and Diane Schanzenbach (2007). The original work exploited the staggered rollout of the Food Stamp Program (FSP) across U.S. counties from 1961–1975 to generate the first large-scale causal estimates of how a major in-kind transfer affects household consumption and labor supply. By leveraging this quasi-experimental variation, Hoynes and Schanzenbach documented that access to food stamps led to a substantial rise in total food expenditures, a decline in out-of-pocket grocery spending, and modest reductions in meals consumed away from home—patterns consistent with canonical economic predictions for in-kind benefits. Their analysis also revealed small but measurable labor-supply responses, aligning with theoretical expectations of income and substitution effects in means-tested programs. 

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the reproducibility and robustness of these core empirical claims. Following the standards of rigorous replication research, we reconstruct the authors’ analysis using independently sourced raw data—county-level Food Stamp adoption dates, detailed transfer-program expenditure measures, and microdata from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)—rather than relying on prepared datasets from the original study. We then re-estimate their key Difference-in-Differences (DiD) specifications, alongside supplemental subgroup analyses, to assess the stability of their conclusions regarding the causal effects of in-kind transfers on consumption behavior and labor market outcomes. 

In the sections that follow, we first provide a concise summary of Hoynes and Schanzenbach’s research question, empirical setting, and core findings, and we reconstruct the datasets used in their analysis before presenting replicated summary statistics. We then turn to replicating the paper’s main empirical results, detailing the identification strategy—centered on county-level variation in Food Stamp Program introduction—and interpreting our reproduced estimates in plain language. Next, we critically evaluate the assumptions underlying the original causal design and assess whether they appear to hold in our reconstructed sample. Finally, we replicate the authors’ robustness checks, including alternative specifications, placebo tests, and subgroup analyses, and discuss the extent to which our findings align with or diverge from the original study’s conclusions.
 
\section{Paper summary and summary statistics table}
\label{sec:title}


\subsection{Summarize the paper’s research question and its answer}


\subsection{Describe the datasets used in answering the question}
The data in this paper is from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) collected by Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan. Hoynes and Schanzenback focus on the data collection from 1968-1978. The original 1968 sample is split into a nationally representative subsample of 3000 households (Survey Research Center subsample) and 1900 households from an existing sample of low income and minoirty populations (Survey of Economic Opportunity subsample). They adjusted for the nonrandom composition, by using "weights designed to eliminate biases attributable to the oversampling of low income groups and to attrition".

The original 1968 sample consists of two subsamples:
a nationally representative subsample of 3,000 households (Survey Research Center subsample) and
a subsample of 1,900 households selected from an existing sample of low income and minority
populations (Survey of Economic Opportunity subsample). To adjust for this nonrandom
composition, the PSID includes weights designed to eliminate biases attributable to the oversampling of low income groups and to attrition. All results use the weights provided by the PSID.





\subsection{Clean the dataset}

\subsubsection{Issues with the data}
The 1968-1978 time frame is used due to the analysis occurring before the purchase requirement was ended. The end of the purchase requirement would make significant effect to any sort of conclusion to make, thus this was an excellent decision. 

For the food consumption analysis 1968 and 1973 are dropped, but they are used for labour supply analysis. In 1968, this is because of inconsistencies in the definition of food variables in that year. This is a valid reason to leave it out. In 1973, food consumption variables were not included in that years' survey.  

In the entire dataset, observations where "the ratio of food
spending to income exceeds 0.85, where total annual food expenditures were less than \textdollar100 (in 2005
dollars) or where annual family income was less than \textdollar500 (in 2005 dollars)" were dropped

\subsubsection{Our methodology}

\subsection{Replicate and interpret a summary statistics table that presents distributional characteristics (mean, median, IQR, etc) of key variables and covariates used in the empirical analysis.}



\section{Replicate the main results}
\label{sec:sections}






\subsection{Describe the empirical method in identifying the causal effect (for instance, whether the researchers conduct a randomized experiment or use policy changes to answer their research questions) and state}


  
\subsection{Replicate the main result of the paper and interpret it in English}

\subsection{Critically appraise the stated assumptions for causal identification. For instance, if the paper is carrying out an experiment, consider whether the experiment is balanced or if it achieves the stated goal of the author. If the paper is using a policy change or another form of “natural experiments”, consider whether
there would be confounding factors}

\section{MULTIMEDIA FIGURES - VIDEO AND AUDIO FILES}

Video and audio files can be included for publication. See Tab.~\ref{tab:Multimedia-Specifications} for the specifications for the mulitimedia files. Use a screenshot or another .jpg illustration for placement in the text. Use the file name to begin the caption. The text of the caption must end with the text ``http://dx.doi.org/doi.number.goes.here'' which tells the SPIE editor where to insert the hyperlink in the digital version of the manuscript. 

Here is a sample illustration and caption for a multimedia file:

\section{MISCELLANEOUS FORMATTING DETAILS}
\label{sec:misc}

It is often useful to refer back (or forward) to other sections in the article.  Such references are made by section number.  When a section reference starts a sentence, Section is spelled out; otherwise use its abbreviation, for example, ``In Sec.~2 we showed...'' or ``Section~2.1 contained a description...''.  References to figures, tables, and theorems are handled the same way.

\subsection{Formatting Equations}
Equations may appear in line with the text, if they are simple, short, and not of major importance; e.g., $\beta = b/r$.  Important equations appear on their own line.  Such equations are centered.  For example, ``The expression for the field of view is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fov}
2 a = \frac{(b + 1)}{3c} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the ...'' Principal equations are numbered, with the equation number placed within parentheses and right justified.  

Equations are considered to be part of a sentence and should be punctuated accordingly. In the above example, a comma follows the equation because the next line is a subordinate clause.  If the equation ends the sentence, a period should follow the equation.  The line following an equation should not be indented unless it is meant to start a new paragraph.  Indentation after an equation is avoided in LaTeX by not leaving a blank line between the equation and the subsequent text.

References to equations include the equation number in parentheses, for example, ``Equation~(\ref{eq:fov}) shows ...'' or ``Combining Eqs.~(2) and (3), we obtain...''  Using a tilde in the LaTeX source file between two characters avoids unwanted line breaks.

\subsection{Formatting Theorems}

To include theorems in a formal way, the theorem identification should appear in a 10-point, bold font, left justified and followed by a period.  The text of the theorem continues on the same line in normal, 10-point font.  For example, 

\noindent\textbf{Theorem 1.} For any unbiased estimator...

Formal statements of lemmas and algorithms receive a similar treatment.
