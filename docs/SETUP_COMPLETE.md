├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── README.md            # Main project documentation
```

### Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/download_data.py`** - Instructions for downloading data from openICPSR
2. **`scripts/01_clean_data.py`** - Data cleaning pipeline (template)
3. **`scripts/02_summary_stats.py`** - Summary statistics replication
4. **`scripts/03_main_results.py`** - Main DiD analysis
5. **`scripts/04_robustness.py`** - Robustness checks (pre-treatment trends)
6. **`scripts/05_ipw_analysis.py`** - IPW re-analysis

### Documentation Created

1. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive project overview and instructions
2. **`docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`** - Information about data sources
3. **`docs/QUICK_START.md`** - Quick reference guide
4. **`docs/SETUP_COMPLETE.md`** - This file

## Next Steps

### 1. Download the Data

Visit: **https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112465**

Download the replication package and extract to `data/raw/`

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Update Scripts

Once you have the data:
- Open `scripts/01_clean_data.py`
- Update file names to match what you downloaded
- Adjust variable names and merge keys as needed

### 4. Run the Analysis

Execute scripts in order:
```bash
python scripts/01_clean_data.py
python scripts/02_summary_stats.py
python scripts/03_main_results.py
python scripts/04_robustness.py
python scripts/05_ipw_analysis.py
```

## Data Location

The replication data is available at:
- **openICPSR**: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112465

The package typically includes:
- Stata `.dta` files with datasets
- Stata `.do` files with original analysis code (useful reference)
- Documentation files

## Project Requirements Coverage

✅ Repository structure set up
✅ Data download instructions provided
✅ Scripts for all analysis steps created
✅ Documentation and README created
✅ Requirements file for dependencies

## Notes

- The scripts are templates that need to be updated once you have the actual data
- Large data files are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`)
- Results can be regenerated by running the scripts
- The original paper PDF is already in the repository

## Ready to Go!

Your repository is now ready. Once you download the data and update the scripts with the actual file names and variable names, you can begin the replication analysis.

Good luck with your project! 🚀
