# Repository Setup Complete! ✅

Your GitHub repository has been set up with all the necessary structure and files to replicate Auffhammer & Kellogg (2011).

## What's Been Created

├── renv/                # R environment (renv)
└── README.md            # Main project documentation
```

### Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/R/setup/`** - R environment setup scripts
2. Analysis scripts will be created in `scripts/R/` or `scripts/`

### Documentation Created

1. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive project overview and instructions
2. **`docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`** - Information about data sources
3. **`docs/QUICK_START.md`** - Quick reference guide
4. **`docs/SETUP_COMPLETE.md`** - This file

## Next Steps

### 1. Download the Data

Visit: **https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112465**

Download the replication package and extract to `data/raw/`

### 2. Set Up R Environment

```r
# In R or RStudio
source("scripts/R/setup/install_essential_packages.R")
```

Or for full setup with renv:
```r
source("scripts/R/setup/setup_renv.R")
```

Verify the environment:
```r
source("tests/environment/check_environment.R")
```

### 3. Update Scripts

Once you have the data:
- Create analysis scripts in `scripts/R/` or `scripts/`
- Update file names to match what you downloaded
- Adjust variable names and merge keys as needed

### 4. Run the Analysis

Analysis scripts will be created in R. Example structure:
```r
# In R or RStudio
source("scripts/R/01_clean_data.R")
source("scripts/R/02_summary_stats.R")
source("scripts/R/03_main_results.R")
source("scripts/R/04_robustness.R")
source("scripts/R/05_ipw_analysis.R")
```

## Data Location

The replication data is available at:
- **openICPSR**: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112465

The package typically includes:
- Stata `.dta` files with datasets
- Stata `.do` files with original analysis code (useful reference)
- Documentation files

## Project Requirements Coverage

✅ Repository structure set up
✅ Data download instructions provided
✅ R environment setup scripts created
✅ Documentation and README created
✅ R environment configured with causal inference packages

## Notes

- The scripts are templates that need to be updated once you have the actual data
- Large data files are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`)
- Results can be regenerated by running the scripts
- The original paper PDF is already in the repository

## Ready to Go!

Your repository is now ready. Once you download the data and update the scripts with the actual file names and variable names, you can begin the replication analysis.

Good luck with your project! 🚀
